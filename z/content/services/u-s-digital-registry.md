Whether for access to emergency, financial or education public services, users need to trust they are engaging with official U.S. government digital accounts.

To help prevent exploitation from unofficial sources, phishing scams, or malicious entities, the [U.S. Digital Registry](https://usdigitalregistry.digitalgov.gov/) serves as a resource for agencies, citizens, and developers to confirm the official status of social media and public-facing collaboration accounts, mobile apps, and mobile websites. The accounts in the registry are independently updated by federal managers across the government who maintain individual agency accounts.
